# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an Astrolabe Smart Account program for Solana - a multi-signature smart wallet solution built with Anchor framework. The project consists of:

- **Rust Program** (`programs/astrolabe_smart_account/`): Core Solana program implementing smart account functionality
- **SDK** (`sdk/`): TypeScript SDK with auto-generated client bindings and high-level functions
- **Generated Clients** (`sdk/clients/`): Auto-generated TypeScript and Rust client libraries from IDL

**Program ID**: `ASTRjN4RRXupfb6d2HD24ozu8Gbwqf6JmS32UnNeGQ6q`

## Development Commands

### Building
- `anchor build` - Compile the Solana program
- `turbo run build` - Build all workspace packages including SDK
- `cd sdk && npm run build` - Build just the SDK

### Testing
- `npm run test` - Run anchor tests with program features
- `npm run test:detached` - Run tests in detached mode
- `cd sdk && npm test` - Run SDK integration tests (requires specific order)

### SDK Test Commands (Must Run in Order)
```bash
cd sdk
npm run test:setup      # Initialize program config√ü
npm run test:create     # Create smart account
npm run test:simple     # Test transactions
npm run test:buffered   # Test complex buffered transaction
```

### Code Generation
- `npx @codama/cli generate` - Regenerate client bindings from IDL using Codama

## Architecture

### Smart Account Features
- **Multi-signature transactions**: Support for threshold-based authorization
- **Transaction batching**: Group multiple transactions for atomic execution  
- **Buffered transactions**: Large transactions split across multiple instructions
- **Spending limits**: Configure per-signer spending restrictions
- **Proposals system**: Create, vote on, and execute governance proposals
- **Settings management**: Authority-based configuration changes
- **Time locks**: Delayed execution for sensitive operations

### Key Program Instructions
- `create_smart_account` - Initialize new smart account
- `create_transaction` / `create_transaction_from_buffer` - Transaction creation
- `execute_transaction` / `execute_transaction_sync` - Transaction execution
- `create_proposal` / `vote_on_proposal` / `activate_proposal` - Governance workflow
- Authority management instructions for signers, spending limits, thresholds

### State Accounts
- `SmartAccount` - Main account storing configuration and signers
- `Transaction` / `TransactionBuffer` - Transaction data and buffered components
- `Proposal` - Governance proposals with voting state
- `SpendingLimit` - Per-signer spending restrictions
- `Batch` / `BatchTransaction` - Transaction batching state

### SDK Architecture
- **Generated Layer** (`clients/js/src/generated/`): Auto-generated from IDL
- **High-level Functions**: `createSmartAccount.ts`, `proposeVoteExecute.ts`, `complexBufferedTransaction.ts`
- **Jupiter Integration**: Complex DeFi interactions via Jupiter API
- **State Management**: Test state persistence across integration tests

## Testing Requirements

SDK tests are **integration tests** requiring a live Solana validator:

1. Start fresh validator: `surfpool start --no-tui`
2. Deploy program: surfpool start automatically deploys the program but it must be configured with tests
3. Tests must run in sequence to maintain blockchain state
4. State files (`test-state.json`, `buffered-test-state.json`) shared between tests

## Development Environment

- **Anchor Version**: 0.31.1
- **Solana Version**: 2.1.21  
- **TypeScript**: 4.9.4
- **Web3.js**: 1.95.5
- **Solana Kit**: 3.0.0

## Important Notes

- Always run `anchor build` before deployment to ensure latest program build
- SDK uses Solana Kit 3.0 - follow its patterns for transaction building
- Generated client files should not be manually edited - regenerate from IDL
- Tests require specific execution order due to state dependencies
- Program uses security-focused features (overflow checks, arithmetic safety)
- surfpool validator is able to pull state directly from mainnet to simulate real program interactions
- setup, createSmartAccount, and simpleTransaction tests are working, buffered tests are not
